# HostPluginDemo-cmake
This is a CMake port of JUCE's [HostPluginDemo](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/master/examples/Plugins/HostPluginDemo.h), which, to my knowledge, is only available as a JUCE [PIP](https://forum.juce.com/t/what-is-a-pip/26821).  
Unlike the original HostPluginDemo, this plugin actually implements audio processing

## Build 
TODO
